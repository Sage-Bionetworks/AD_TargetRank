## status: getting information about the commit tree
## For each tissue specified in configs/M62.yaml the coexpression of genes specified in genelists/ModuleM62.txt is given. This is measured as a percentage of 1000 pemutations in which the gene was a significant predictor of expression of its comparison gene by a linear model.
